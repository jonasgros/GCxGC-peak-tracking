# GCxGC peak-tracking algorithm
This algorithm is used to track peaks across GCxGC chromatograms (e.g., GCxGC-FID or GCxGC-ECD) according to the method of 
<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es8013908">Wardlaw et al., 2008</a> which was updated to biodegradation experiments (allowing peaks to disappear). The algorithm
is programmed in Matlab.
